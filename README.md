# IntentFlow
### AI SEO Intelligence Platform

IntentFlow is a full-stack intelligence platform that captures invisible user behavior from AI chat providers—ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok—and materializes it into structured, deterministic SEO campaign data.

## The Problem

Traditional SEO tools monitor Google searches. But as users migrate to conversational AI search, those queries—and the sites AI models cite—are invisible to standard analytics. IntentFlow bridges this visibility gap by intercepting live AI streams, parsing them into hierarchical campaign trees, and enriching them with third-party SEO data.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-Provider Interception** | Captures live streams from ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Grok simultaneously via a Chrome Manifest V3 extension. |
| **Deterministic Tree Mapping** | Every conversation is materialized into a stable `Prompt → Subquery → Site` tree using deterministic SHA-1 hashing. |
| **Campaign Versioning** | Snapshot campaigns and "refire" them to track how AI-cited sites change over time. |
| **SEO Enrichment** | Background queues (BullMQ) auto-enrich sites with SEMrush and Ahrefs keyword volume, traffic estimates, and rankings. |
| **Lead Intelligence** | Extracts buying-intent signals from raw prompt text and scores users by behavioral intent. |
| **Admin RBAC Dashboard** | Granular, multi-tenant role-based access control with full administrative visibility. |
| **AI Prompt Suggestions** | Uses OpenAI GPT to suggest follow-up prompts based on campaign history. |

## System Architecture

IntentFlow is a **monorepo** containing three independently deployable surfaces that communicate over HTTPS via REST APIs and JWT authentication.

Data Flow
End-to-End Ingestion Pipeline
Intercept: The extension injects a MAIN-world script into ChatGPT/Claude/etc., bypassing CSP via manifest.json declarations. It intercepts SSE/streaming HTTP responses.
Parse: Prompts, internal search queries, and cited websites are extracted from the raw token stream.
Relay: Data is relayed from the isolated content script to the background service worker via chrome.runtime ports.
Ingest: The backend API (POST /campaigns/:id/ingest-turn) receives a structured JSON payload.
Materialize: CampaignService.ingestTurn() normalizes the data, resolves the active CampaignVersion, and builds the PromptNode tree (root → subqueries → sites).
Enrich: SEMrush/Ahrefs jobs are pushed to BullMQ for asynchronous keyword/traffic enrichment.
Signal: LeadIntelligenceService extracts buying-intent signals fire-and-forget.
Visualize: The extension side-panel and web dashboard receive the updated tree in real time.
Campaign Versioning & Refiring
v1 is created automatically upon first ingestion.
Users can refire a campaign, creating a v2 snapshot to compare how AI responses drift over time.
Database Design
Core Entities
Table	Purpose
User	Platform users, auth credentials, app roles.
Tenant	Organization/account boundary.
TenantMember	Join table linking users to tenants with roles (owner/member).
Campaign	An SEO campaign linked to a tenant.
CampaignVersion	Point-in-time snapshot of a campaign.
CaptureSession	One AI chat conversation.
CaptureTurn	One prompt-response exchange within a session.
PromptNode	Self-referencing tree node: prompt, subquery, site, or generated.
SemrushSnapshot	Cached SEO data (24h TTL).
LeadSignal	Extracted intent signals from a turn.
The Campaign Tree (Adjacency List)
The central data model is a self-referencing PromptNode tree:

Node Type	Parent	Example Content
prompt	null (root)	"best SEO tools 2026"
subquery	prompt	"top seo software"
site	subquery	ahrefs.com
generated	prompt (sibling)	"compare seo pricing"
All internal references use deterministic SHA-1 hashes (provider + turn_id + query_key + site_name + url) instead of random UUIDs to guarantee idempotency across multiple ingestion runs.

System Design Principles
Principle	Implementation
N-Tier Layering	Strict 4-layer backend: Routes → Controller → Service → Repository. Swapping the database only touches the Repository layer.
Multi-Tenancy	Every record carries a tenant_id. Row-level security is enforced in the Repository layer; no tenant can access another's data.
Event-Driven Processing	Heavy enrichment tasks (SEMrush, Ahrefs, NLP) are offloaded to BullMQ workers using the Producer-Consumer pattern.
Idempotency	ingestTurn() checks request_id + turn_exchange_id before writing, preventing duplicates from network retries.
Caching	SEMrush/Ahrefs results are cached in SemrushSnapshot with a 24-hour TTL to prevent expensive repeated API calls.
RBAC	Dual-role system: App Role (admin vs user) and Tenant Role (owner vs member), enforced by middleware on every protected route.
DTO Validation	All incoming API bodies are validated with Zod schemas before reaching controllers.
Object-Oriented Design
IntentFlow leverages TypeScript's full OOP capabilities:

Abstraction: BaseController, BaseService, and BaseRepository define structural contracts for the entire backend.
Encapsulation: CampaignService hides complex deduplication, versioning, and mapping logic behind private methods; the public API remains simple (ingestTurn, createCampaign, getActiveTree).
Inheritance: All concrete controllers, services, and repositories extend their respective abstract base classes.
Interfaces: Strict structural typing via ApiSuccessResponse<T>, CanonicalNodeMetadata, MaterializedSubquery, etc.
Polymorphism: ApiResponse.success<T>() is method-polymorphic based on generic type T. The extension uses runtime polymorphism for provider-specific stream interception strategies.
Singleton Pattern: Services and controllers are instantiated once at module load to prevent redundant DB connections.
Dependency Injection: CampaignService receives its repository via constructor injection, enabling isolated unit testing with mock repositories.
Factory Pattern: ApiResponse factory standardizes all controller response envelopes.
Strategy Pattern: Each AI provider implements a distinct content-script strategy (chatgptStreamContent.ts, claudeStreamContent.ts, etc.) behind a uniform event-posting contract.
